\#ziplib (SharpZipLib, formerly NZipLib) is a **Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library** written entirely in C\# for the .NET framework. It is implemented as an assembly (installable in the GAC), and thus can easily be incorporated into other projects (in any .NET language). The creator of #ziplib put it this way: "I've ported the zip library over to C\# because I needed gzip/zip compression and I didn't want to use libzip.dll or something like this. I want all in pure C\#."

Introduction
------------

SharpZipLib was originally ported from the [GNU Classpath](http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) java.util.zip library for use with [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD), which needed gzip/zip compression. bzip2 compression and tar archiving were added later due to popular demand.

There is a web site from which You can download the assembly and/or the source code (<http://icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SharpZipLib>). A forum is also available at http://community.sharpdevelop.net/forums/12/ShowForum.aspx.

Please see the [\#ziplib homepage](http://icsharpcode.github.io/SharpZipLib/) for precompiled downloads, license information, link to the forum (support), release history, samples and more.
